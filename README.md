This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a common error related to integer division. The program calculates the result of dividing two numeric variables and displays the result. However, the program does not handle potential exceptions, such as division by zero, which can lead to program termination or unexpected results. The solution file provides a corrected version of the program that incorporates error handling to prevent these issues.
